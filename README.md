# KhanAcademy-content-Analysis

Khan academy is a most used online education platform. It provides free world class education to anyone anywhere. In this project, I am trying to find out answers to few questions. This analysis can help people who are trying to build education related content on youtube. 

What we are trying to analyze is:
1.What sort of education content is most popular on khan academy?\n
2.Which type of content was more popular during covid?\n
3.Is there any relationship between views and comments?\n

We measure our results based on views, comments, likes and dislikes.

•	Views: What gets people to hear an idea?

•	Likes/Dislikes: What makes people like/dislike the video?

•	Comments: What kinds of topics produce discussions?

**Data source:** The data for this project is scrapped through khan academy’s youtube channel for teachers.
