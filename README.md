# ETL for data analysis

Khan academy is a most used online education platform. In this project, I am trying to find out answers to few questions. This analysis can help people who are trying to build education related content on youtube. 

What we are trying to analyze is:</br>
1.What sort of education content is most popular on khan academy?</br>
2.Which type of content was more popular during covid?</br>
3.Is there any relationship between views and comments?
For this I have scraped data from youtube API and pre-processed it using python. The pre-processed data is then used for data analysis.

We measure our results based on views, comments, likes and dislikes.

•	Views: What gets people to hear an idea?

•	Likes/Dislikes: What makes people like/dislike the video?

•	Comments: What kinds of topics produce discussions?


**Data source:** The data for this project is scrapped through khan academy’s youtube channel for teachers.
